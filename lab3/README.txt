Lab 3 - Decimal Converter
02C Michael Powell
Due 11/01/17

I had many many algorithms in the code in order to have the converter process the transformation of numbers. There’s a first algorithm that places out all of the phrases used to introduce what the system is and also display the user inputted number and also a output line that later outputs the binary version of the inputted number. The next algorithm finds if there is a “-“ or negative symbol and if there is then it jumps to the loop for the negative numbers. If it does not identify the “-“ then it will proceed to the positive loop to convert the number to decimal. Do to the many terminals use it became very difficult to understand and sometimes I made mistakes when programming the loop. After both loops are done they go to the converter that converts the decimal to binary and prints out the 1’s and 0’s. After finishing all 32 bits the function ends and exits the program.

Some techniques I learned and used was storing numbers into certain terminals and extracting them when needed and organizing the use of terminals in order to keep them in track. Also learning loops and being able to implement them into the code in order to convert numbers from the user input to decimals. Also learning how to use bit masks in order to start the transformation of binary. 

When using psuedo-ops, there were many lines of code needed in order to setup the proper function sometimes taking 3 to 4 lines of the program in order to initiate one simple task in the code.
