Lab 1: Intro to Logic with Multimedia Logic 
02C Michael Powell

If you did not have a digital display a way to make one would be to use the LED lights that are already in MultiMedia Logic and arrange 13 (or more if you would like to make it neater) of them in a figure 8 form. Using a truth table we could assign values in binary for the input and the output would be a bit that represents a line that is lit. And eventually all of the lines can be turned on and off with a series of AND and OR gates to change which lights are on or off.

I believe the Random Number Generator works by creating a large but finite amount of outputs from the given input of 0 and 1 by running them through many AND and OR gates to keep creating large quantities of output scenarios. By doing this there will be many possible outputs that can either be 0 or 1 in MML to perform the function of outputting a random number.
