Lab 2 - Adding and Subtracting
02C Michael Powell
Due 10/22/17

Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to learn how to use MultiMedia Logic with a further understanding and learn how to make a 6-bit ripple adder that is made to do addition and subtraction with unsigned 6-bit binary numbers.

Methods
Using MultiMedia Logic, we made four separate pages for each different function and testing it along the way to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to do. First page was for inputting and outputting the values used throughout the whole ripple adder. Then I made a register to store the numbers and also the adder for each bit. Then finally I made a selective inverter to invert the bits that would be used and also added one to get the additive inverse to the number that was inputted from the first page.

Results
I made a working MultiMedia Logic project that could add and subtract as intended. 

Analysis
Throughout the lab there were many mistakes made and understanding what each part in MultiMedia Logic did was quite difficult but doing the lab helped me strengthen my understanding of the program. The combination of different parts such as the flip-flop and the signal sender and receiver made the program look much cleaner and easier to understand even though there is a lot going on in the program.

Questions
Building the adder was one of the most difficult parts of this lab and understanding where to connect everything and how to arrange everything was difficult. Connecting it to the main system was difficult to understand. To make the debugging easier in the lab I would make a different input and carry in bit in order to keep testing if the adder was working and once it worked I just connected it to the main system. 

When a larger number is subtracted from a smaller number, the display that is outputted starts from 63 which is the largest number possible 6-bit binary number. When two numbers are added together that wonâ€™t fit in 6-bits, the display just starts from 0 again. Both of these results make total sense since the 7 segment display cannot show negative numbers and also the addition of numbers totaling more than 6 bits and subtracting numbers larger than another number causes the leading bit to be thrown away thus proving that the functions of this adder is correct.
